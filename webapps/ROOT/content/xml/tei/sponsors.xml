                 <p>The first sponsors of our work in <ref target="https://sourceforge.net/p/epidoc/wiki/Home/">EpiDoc</ref> were the <ref target="https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/">Leverhulme Trust</ref>, who, in 2002, funded Charlotte Roueché and Tom Elliott to work on 
                     the development of EpiDoc for publishing the 
                     Inscriptions of Aphrodisisias in 2002 (see <ref target="http://www.epapp.kcl.ac.uk/">EPAPP</ref>). 
                     The resultant publications were funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Board (later the <ref target="https://ahrc.ukri.org/">Arts and Humanities Research Council</ref>) 
                     (see <ref target="http://insaph.kcl.ac.uk/index.html">InsAph</ref>)</p>
                 <p>In 2007 we received a new grant from the Leverhulme Trust to publish the corpus of the Inscriptions of Roman Cyrenaica, eastern Libya. 
                     The project has taken a long time, but there have been gains along the way.
                 </p>
                 <p>In 2008 Elliott and Roueché received a grant from <ref target="https://www.jisc.ac.uk/">JISC</ref> in the UK and the 
                     <ref target="https://www.neh.gov/">National Endowment for the Humanities</ref> in the USA for a collaborative project to explore the publication of inscriptions in 
                 association with geodata (see <ref target="https://concordia.atlantides.org/">Concordia</ref>); 
                     this enabled the publication of the <ref target="http://inslib.kcl.ac.uk/irt2009/index.html">Inscriptions of Roman Tripolitania</ref>, 
                     western Libya, in 2009, 
                 from which we gained important understandings of how to publish the material from Cyrenaica.
               </p>
                 <p>On the basis of the geographical data collected for the Concordia project Dr Hafed Walda went on to collect the relevant geodata for Cyrenaica; 
                     he was funded by a Libyan Heritage Management Fellowship provided by Global Business Services. These data were then deployed in the 
                   <ref target="http://www.slsgazetteer.org/">Heritage Gazetteer of Libya</ref>; some of the underlying structure was drawn from work funded by the <ref target="http://www.leventisfoundation.org/en/">A.G Leventis Foundation</ref>, 
                     for the <ref target="http://www.cyprusgazetteer.org/">Heritage Gazetteer of Cyprus</ref>, but the main grant came from 
                     the <ref target="https://www.societyforlibyanstudies.org/">Society for Libyan Studies</ref>.</p>
                 <p>In 2016 Dr Gabriel Bodard, a member of the team, received a grant from the <ref target="https://mellon.org/">Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</ref> to 
                     develop EFES, a new publication platform for texts prepared in EpiDoc. In 2018 Roueché received a grant from the Society for Libyan Studies to 
                 set up the Cyrenaican corpus in EFES. A further grant from the Society has enabled the current publication.</p>
