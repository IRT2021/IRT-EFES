                    collected and prepared almost all the texts presented here, with the support of many colleagues in Libya and elsewhere.</p>

                <p>Gabriel Bodard (<ref target="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8566-6666">ORCID</ref>) worked with Reynolds and Roueché 
                    on the editing and standardisation of texts, and also oversaw the digitisation and the construction of the publication, 
                    and use of EpiDoc standards. He was responsible for training many research assistants, 
                    student volunteers and other collaborators who worked on the project.</p>
