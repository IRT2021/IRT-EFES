                    collected and prepared almost all the texts presented here, with the support of many colleagues in Libya and elsewhere.</p>
                <p>Charlotte Roueché (<ref target="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3606-2049">ORCID</ref>) continued and standardised the editing, 
                    adding further texts and refernces, bibliography and translations. 
                </p>
                <p>Gabriel Bodard (<ref target="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8566-6666">ORCID</ref>) worked with Reynolds and Roueché 
                    on the editing and standardisation of texts, and also oversaw the digitisation and the construction of the publication, 
                    and use of EpiDoc standards. He was responsible for training many research assistants, 
                    student volunteers and other collaborators who worked on the project.</p>
                
                <p>Catherine Dobias-Lalou (<ref target="http://viaf.org/viaf/29572722">VIAF</ref>) provided significant editorial assistance,

                <p>Hafed Walda provided geodata, which formed the basis from 
                    which Neil Jakeman created the Heritage Gazetteer of Libya; 
                    Walda also contributed an important collection of photographs, as did Dorothy Thorn (<ref target="http://viaf.org/viaf/56142832">VIAF</ref>)
