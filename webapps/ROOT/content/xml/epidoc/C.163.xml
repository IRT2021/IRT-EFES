                              Goodchild found seven additional pieces of the stele, all re-used 
                              in late buildings, the largest of them re-cut to serve as a column-base in the 
                              sixth-century church on the south side of the street. Clearly the stone was broken up 
                              and its elements dispersed by builders in the early Byzantine period.

Since the Bereniceans request that the assize should be held in each city in turn,
I replied that it is not clear how the cities which already have an assize will take it if they do not have it annually as in the past;

            <head>Commentary</head>
            <p>The original location of the monument remains a matter of conjecture. 
               Its weight alone would suggest an original location not very far from the 
                  Valley Street where its pieces were found. Moreover it is not the only 
               stone found re-used in this area which is concerned with the koinon.
               there is also a later inscription <!--(unpublished)--> referring specifically to provincial affairs. 
               Goodchild inclined to think that in the fifth century CE there were provincial 
               meetings focussed on the area of the Market Theatre, which in fact stands 
               beside the Valley Street; but as far as I am aware he did not seriously consider where they may 
               have taken place earlier. It seems worth suggesting that it was in the Caesareum, 
               less than 200 yards away, from which stones were demonstrably brought for re-use 
               in the later phases of the Valley Street buildings; it had been devoted to the cult 
               of Rome (and no doubt the imperial house) at least from the time of Augustus (For the dedication 
               of the Caesareum to Rome (presumably with Augustus) see <ref type="inscription" n="C.2">C.2</ref>); 
               while its porticoes, great courtyard, basilica, temple and adjacent theatre were eminently 
               suitable for the purposes of a provincial assembly. Only when the Caesareum was 
               converted into a fort in the later third century was something else required 
               <!-- (R. G. Goodchild, op. cit. (n. 2), 74 f.) -->.</p>
            <p>Goodchild made a careful study of the pieces he found 
               and drew a reconstruction of the whole stele (reproduced in Reynolds, op.cit. Pl. II) in which he located 
               exactly all but one; this loose piece belonged, without doubt, in the area between 
               lines 48 and 63 where too little of the text survives for any precision in interpretation.</p>
            <p>P. M. Fraser (op. cit above published 
               from a photograph a considerable but incomplete inscription 
               comprising documents sent to the city of Cyrene by Hadrian (and possibly 
               others during his reign). It seemed natural to relate them to the material and moral 
               damage caused by the Jewish Revolt of CE 115-17, although Fraser thought that they
               had been inscribed much later. Subsequent discussion was concentrated mainly 
               on the opening sections, concerned with representation in the Panhellenion 
               <!--(H. Oliver, Hesperia XX (1951), 32f. andHesperia 
               Supp. xiii, 95 f., no. 7;   J. A. O. Larsen
               Cl. Phil, xlvii (1952), 7 f.;   C. B.  Welles,   AJA
               lvi   (1952),   76   f.;    J.   and   line    Robert,   Bulletin
               Epigraphique  1950, no.  243 ;    1953, no.  255;   AE
               1951, no. 122;   1953, no. 120)-->.</p>
            <p>The fuller version was published by Reynolds, op.cit, above) in 1978. The documents that it contains turned out to be more numerous than originally appeared and although 
               diverse in content are linked by the point that all demonstrate the superiority of Cyrene over the 
               other cities of the province. She is a metropolis, the venue of the governors' assize courts, the site 
               of the provincial imperial cult; and when her position was challenged both Hadrian and Pius 
               maintained it, even, perhaps, enhanced it. Clearly the inscription was cut to demonstrate this ‚Äî and 
               points stressed in earlier discussions, such as the problems of Cyrene after the Jewish Revolt, the 
               importance of the Gymnasium, the membership of Cyrenaican cities in the Panhellenion, are incidental
               to the main purpose of the inscribing authority. In view of this it is extremely unlikely that the stele 
               was ever erected in any gymnasium. It needed to be in an area frequented on those occasions when 
               the citizens of other Cyrenaican cities assembled at Cyrene for meetings of the provincial koinon.</p>
            <p>The first document, lines 1-78, is a letter of Hadrian to the people of Cyrene dated to CE 134/5, about two years after the foundation 
               of the Panhellenion and, as Oliver (op.cit.) points out, at a stage when consideration of applications 
               for membership must have taken up much of the time of its officers. Hadrian writes briefly to the Cyrenaeans on a subject on which he has been 
               consulted by the&#x2028; archon of the Panhellenion, and apparently also, though later, by the 
               Cyrenaeans themselves, though&#x2028; a Cyrenaean approach to the archon is probably implied as well. 
               He has made a decision, incorporated in a rescript to the archon, sends an additional document 
               to the Cyrenaeans and also refers to some action of the proconsul Salvius Carus.</p>
            <p>The second document is a copy of a letter from Antoninus Pius to 
               Ptolemais dated by his titles to 153/4. Again the general lines are absolutely clear. 
               The Ptolemaeans, through their ambassador Valerius Pausanias, had asked for permission 
               to hold an ·ºÄŒ≥œéŒΩ in their city; Pius replied, apparently sarcastically, that they had hitherto 
               been wisely satisfied to participate in the common sacrifice and ·ºÄŒ≥œéŒΩ held at Cyrene, 
               and were well aware that innovations of this sort carried the stigma of inter-city rivalry.   
               The common sacrifice had been established for the whole province.
            </p>
            <p>The dossier as it now stands ‚Äî for all the gaps in the first document ‚Äî is the major piece 
               of evidence for the history of Cyrenaica in the mid-second century. All three cities which figure 
               in it had, undoubtedly, suffered in the Jewish Revolt; but by 153/4 were, as we now see, struggling 
               for status in the same way as the rich cities of Asia. Berenice and Ptolemais must have been wealthy 
               enough to make their pleas for privilege plausible. They 
               presumably calculated also on a reduction in the resources of Cyrene, but the emperors backed 
               Cyrene, the traditional capital, and she was vigorous enough to hit back at her rivals in the
               publication of these documents.</p><p>It is also interesting for the light that it throws on provincial life and administration 
               in a number of ways ; and not least because it includes two of the rare surviving instances of 
               imperial decisions unfavourable to the applicants; cf. F. Millar, <title>The Emperor in the Roman 
               World</title> (1977), 431 f., 436, 438 f., pointing out that the record provided by inscriptions is heavily
               biassed. Unfavourable decisions are likely to have been inscribed only when it suited a rival 
               to publicize them, as here and in the instances that Millar cites from Coronea in Boeotia,

               Dr. Wynne Williams in correspondence); ‚Ä®but the emperor's title is given in full so that a 
               summary is surprising, and the phenomenon recurs ‚Ä®in the letter of Antoninus Pius to 
               Ptolemais, 11. 78-80 below. An obvious parallel is in the imperial‚Ä® 
               correspondence with Delphi which is addressed ŒîŒ≠ŒªœÜœâŒΩ œÑ·øá œÄœåŒªŒµŒπ 
               (cf. Fouilles de Delphes m. IV. 3, nos.‚Ä®301, 302); presumably the emperor tended 
               to pick up the description used by his correspondents‚Ä® of themselves or by a third 
               party, as here, no doubt, by the archon of the Panhellenion.

            <p>Lines 6f:  In 1. 6 the 
               reading ·ºêœÜ<unclear>Œ∏</unclear>Œ¨Œ∫ŒµŒπ (the crossbar of Œë seems to me clear) 
               antiquates much of the discussion of this line; for the use of œÜŒ∏Œ¨ŒΩœâ in this kind of context cf. 
               the letter of an archon of the Panhellenion in 157/8 (OGIS 507 = Oliver, Hesperia Supp. XIII, 115, 
               no. 30, line  4 f., œÜŒ∏Œ¨ŒΩŒøŒºŒµŒΩ. . . ·º†ŒæŒπœâŒ∫œåœÑŒµœ≤). It needs to be complemented by a participle on which 
               ·ºêœÄŒπœÉœÑŒµ·øñŒªŒ±Œπ must depend. Something, perhaps, with the sense of 
               œÉœÄŒøœÖŒ¥Œ¨Œ∂œâŒΩ must be supposed later in the line ‚Äî the archon had already been zealous 
               to send to Hadrian on the subject on which the Cyrenaeans had made their request 
               (for this sense of ·ºÄŒæŒØœâœÉŒπœ≤ see H. J. Mason, <title>Greek Terms for Roman Institutions</title> s.v.). 
               It would appear from what follows that Cyrene was already a member of the Panhellenion and was asking for something more. 
               Line  9 shows that one request was rejected as improper; 
               since it is not rational to suppose that the Cyrenaeans would advertise the fact if it were theirs 
               (and this argument is strengthened by the extended context into which the document 
               must now be fitted), this should refer to an application for membership 
               made by a rival of the Cyrenaeans. Line 6 should threfore mean that the Cyrenaean request was 
               for the rejection of this application, which must have been indicated at the end of the line. 
               We have no clue to the identity of the rejected group. In line 7, Hadrian states that he has replied as seemed right to him and 
               sent something to the Cyrenaeans ‚Ä®as well. Thius seems likely to be 
               a copy of his own rescript to the archon of the ‚Ä®Panhellenion and so, perhaps, something like
               œÑ·Ω¥ŒΩ œÄœÅŒøŒ∫ŒµŒπŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒ∑ŒΩ ·ºÄœÄœåŒ∫œÅŒπœÉŒπŒΩ stood here (a word with‚Ä® the sense of copy rather than of answer would
               be more satisfying, but ·ºÄœÄŒøŒ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒÆ seems not to be attested‚Ä® in this sense in the Roman 
               period, cf. Mason, loc. cit. under 1. 6 f., and Preisigke, Worterbuch, s.v.).‚Ä®The link with 
               Salvius could have been made by a phrase on the lines of ·Ω°œÇ œÄœÅŒøœÉŒ¥Œµ·øñœÑŒ±ŒØ ŒºŒøœÖ, as Salvius‚Ä® asked of me, 
               implying, no doubt, that the Cyrenaean request was made through the proconsul‚Ä®and not 
               directly to the emperor by means of an embassy. </p>
          <p>ll. 8-12 continued then, I suggest, with the substance of Hadrian's reply to the archon rather than
               ‚Ä®of a letter either to or from the proconsul, or indeed of another letter from the emperor to Cyrene.‚Ä®
               It needed no new heading because it was already explained by Hadrian's statement in 
               lines 7-8.‚Ä® Unfortunately the new fragment adds little here and any reconstruction must be 
               very tentative indeed.‚Ä® I follow Oliver2 in thinking that the text refers first to a group whose 
               claim to representation in‚Ä®the Panhellenion was in some way improper; 
               and since line  10 clearly refers to true Greek descent,‚Ä® I presume that it was in this matter that it failed, 
               so that it was not entitled to representation in the‚Ä®Panhellenion at all, rather than that it was 
               not entitled to as many representatives as Cyrene. With‚Ä® Oliver2, therefore, I reject the proposal 
               of Oliver1 for the end of line  8 (œÄŒµœÅ·Ω∂ œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ ŒöœÖœÅŒ∑ŒΩŒ±ŒØœâŒΩ ŒªŒµŒ≥œåŒΩœÑœâŒΩ ·ΩÖœÑŒπ) ‚Ä®for something such as he substitutes 
               here‚ÄîŒªŒ≠Œ≥ŒøœÖœÉŒπŒΩ ·ΩÖœÑŒπ œÉœçŒΩŒµŒ¥œÅŒøŒΩ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ·ºêŒæ Œ±·ΩêœÑ·ø∂ŒΩ , though I think that these‚Ä® rejected claimants 
               must have been named. In line  10, where Fraser and Oliver1 saw references to the‚Ä® heroes 
               Achaeus and Dorus, it is now clear that we have adjectives qualifying Œ≥Œ≠ŒΩŒøœÉ; cf. Œ¥Œπ·Ω∞ œÑ·Ω∏ Œ≥Œ≠ŒΩŒøœÇ ·ºôŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫œåŒΩ 
               in the justification for allowing representation in the Panhellenion to Cibyra, Oliver,‚Ä®Hesperia Supp. xiii 95, 
               no. 6. There can be no serious doubt that the Cyrenaeans are in question‚Ä® here; 
               but, as Fraser noted, ·ºÄŒ∫œÅŒµŒπŒ≤·ø∂œÇ presents difficulties and these do not seem to me to be solved‚Ä®
               completely by the translation of Oliver2, in the truest sense. 
               It may be that the Theran dialect shows ‚Ä®affinities with Achaean as well as Laconian 
               (Oliver quotes F. Kiechle, Lakonien und Sparta, Vestigia‚Ä®v (1963), 81-95 in this connection), 
               implying two elements in the Theran population which the ‚Ä®Theran colonists of Cyrene will have 
               brought with them; but the run of the sentence surely sug‚Ä®gests not two elements in Cyrene's 
               original population but a wider definition narrowed down to a‚Ä®more precise one by ·ºÄŒ∫œÅŒµŒπŒ≤·ø∂œÇ. 
               Could the phrase mean Greek and strictly Dorian (as suggested to me‚Ä®by Mrs. P. E. Easterling)?
               Oliver restores lines 9-11 to give : Œ¥Œ≠œáŒµœÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ Œ¥Œµ·øñ¬∑ Œø·Ωê ŒºŒ≠ŒΩœÑŒøŒπ Œ¥ŒØŒ∫Œ±ŒπŒ±

               The new fragment necessitates some alterations in this at the end of 1. 10 and before the 
               break in 1. 11; but in addition to these it seems to me difficult to take ·º∞Œ∏Œ±Œ≥ŒµŒΩŒÆœÇ in the
               sense indigenous rather than true-born, with reference to the ysvos which has just been 
               mentioned. If 81 is adversative then perhaps we should expect ·º∞Œ∏Œ±Œ≥ŒµŒΩŒµ·øñœÇ Œø·ΩêŒ∫ ·ΩÑŒΩœÑŒµœÇ; 
               but I wonder whether this is so and would suggest, tentatively, that ocuTof might be 
               the Cyrenaeans. The essential part of the statement made in 11. 9-10 would then be that 
               Cyrene had been founded by Greeks and the Cyrenaeans themselves remained
               of pure stock. I suggest for consideration something on the following lines, 
               although I am conscious that it is not entirely satisfying, notably because it is 
               not normal to speak of a race as despatching colonists:
               Œ¥Œ≠œáŒµœÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ Œ¥Œµ·øñ¬∑ Œø·Ωê ŒºŒ≠ŒΩœÑŒøŒπ Œ¥ŒØŒ∫Œ±ŒπŒ± ·ºÄŒæŒπŒø·ø¶œÉŒπŒΩ¬∑ œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ Œ±·ΩêœÑ·ø∑<supplied reason="lost">ŒΩ

                  reason="lost" extent="unknown" unit="character"/>
               The new fragment suggests that a new sentence began near the end of line  10, 
               perhaps with an adjective of two terminations qualifying œÄœÅŒøœÉŒ∑Œ≥ŒøœÅŒØŒ±ŒΩ in line  II, ? 
               And they obtained in addition the glorious (?) title; 
               thereafter, on the basis of Fraser's first reading, Oliver2 suggested some part of 
               ·ºêœÄŒπŒ∫œÅœçœÄœÑŒµœÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ, and a reference to irregular infiltration into the Hellenic citizen body. 
               With ·ºêœÄŒπŒ∫œÅŒ±<gap reason="lost" extent="unknown" unit="character"/>  for ·ºêœÄŒπŒ∫œÅœÖ<gap reason="lost" extent="unknown" unit="character"/> we are more likely to have
               ·ºêœÄŒπŒ∫œÅŒ±Œµ·øñŒΩ = to prevail over, referring perhaps to a title derived from Cyrene's predominance 
               in the region. In lines 19 and 21 there occurs the title ŒºŒ∑œÑœÅœåœÄŒøŒªŒπœÇ in which Cyrene took considerable 
               pride in the second half of the second century, to judge by the number of times it appears in 
               inscriptions. I would suggest the possibility that this is the title in question and that the word 
               itself occurred in the missing part of line  10; while originally an expression of her claim to have 
               founded the other cities of the territory, it also became, in the Roman context, a statement of 
               her superior rank in the province.
            </p><p>1. 12, Fraser and Oliver1 (no comment by Oliver 2), taking œÄŒµŒºœÄœåŒΩœÑœâŒΩ 
               as an imperative, seem to envisage translating let them send two synhedroi to the city 
               of the Cyrenaeans, which can hardly be right. Larsen takes œÄœåŒªŒπŒΩ as belonging to the 
               preceeding phrase and œÄŒµŒºœÄœåŒΩœÑœâŒΩ as a participle, which seems to be easier, 
               with the Cyrenaeans ?accordingly (so Larsen) sending two synhedroi (sc. to the Panhellenion). 
               It must be admitted that the reference to two representatives from Cyrene might 
               suggest that the rivals were allowed to send one; although the stress may be wholly 
               on œÄŒµŒºœÄœåŒΩœÑœâŒΩ, with the figure added only as an incidental fact.
            </p><p>1. 13 gives a new heading and it seems to me that this must introduce a new 
               (and later) document, quite possibly on a new aspect of Cyrene's status.
               The name of the writer of the letter which is summarized is lost; Fraser has proposed Hadrian, 
               Oliver the governor and Welles the Cyrenaeans themselves. The last solution is ruled out, as 
               Oliver2 has already noted, by ducov and not in lines 16, 17, demonstrating that a singular subject 
               addresses a plural object; there is of course no objection, as supposed by Welles, 
               to making excerpts from imperial letters and a clear instance of the practice occurs on this stele at line  64. 
               In the context as we now have it the subject is overwhelmingly likely to have been an emperor 
               and pretty certainly Hadrian whose name I have tentatively restored; the content seems to 
               indicate that his letter was addressed to Cyrene.
            </p><p>l. 14, I follow Fraser in reading ·ºòœÄŒπœÑŒ≠ŒªŒøœÖœÇ, a personal name in the genitive case, 
               and subject of œÄœÅŒøœÉŒ∫ŒµŒπŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒøœÖ (Oliver preferred ·ºêœÄ·Ω∂ œÑŒ≠ŒªŒøœÖœÇ, taking the subject to be the governor, 
               and probably the Salvius Carus named in the previous document who was, in his view, 
               the writer of this letter); and I suggest that Epiteles is as likely to have been a Cyrenaean 
               ambassador as an archon of the Panhellenion (so Fraser). It remains far from clear what 
               was the one thing on which he insisted. At the end of the line all editors have proposed
               ·ºêœÄŒ≠Œ∏ŒµœÉ<supplied reason="lost">Œ±ŒΩ</supplied>, but another possibility is ·ºêœÄŒµŒ∏Œ≠œÉ<supplied 
                  reason="lost">œÄŒπœÉŒµŒΩ</supplied>, with Apollo as subject. In lines 27, 28 there is a reference 
               to the Apolline oracles on which the first founders of Cyrene acted;  they could also 
               have formed the core of Epiteles' argument.
            </p><p>l. 15, œÉœÖŒºœÜŒ≠œÅŒµŒπŒΩ, read by Oliver from the photograph, 
               is certainly right. If an Apolline oracle was mentioned in 1. 14, the accusative and 
               infinitive construction here must give part of its content and Œ±·ΩêœÑœåŒΩ should be Battus. 
               There is a difficulty in the suggestion of H. M. Last (ap. Fraser) that œÄœÅŒøœÖœÄŒøœÉœÖŒªŒªŒ≠Œ≥ŒµŒπŒΩ = Latin sublegere, 
               but there is no real need to look beyond the Greek sense of the word, to collect gradually in advance.
            </p><p>ll. 16 f., too little survives for assured reconstruction and it is not easy to see how
               ·ºêœÄŒ≠Œ¥œâŒ∫Œ≠ ŒºŒøŒπ fits in; perhaps Epiteles gave Hadrian a document (? a Cyrenaean decree) 
               which stressed preservation (cf. Fraser's Œ¥ŒπŒµ<unclear>œÉ</unclear><supplied 
                  reason="lost">·ø∂œÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ</supplied> in line  16) of the memory of the ancient nobility 
               in a Cyrene founded in accordance with Apolline oracles, and made proposals for 
               some reform (cf. Fraser's <supplied reason="lost">Œ∫Œ±œÑŒøœÅ</supplied>Œ∏œâŒ∏<supplied 
                  reason="lost">ŒÆ</supplied>œÉŒµœÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ in lines 16/17).
            </p><p>ll. 17 f., a new sentence obviously begins at ŒΩ·ø¶ŒΩ in line  17; but in lines 18/19 the 
               writer may have returned to the past with descriptions of Cyrene as most populous 
               and most beautiful and (although I have no explanation of how the change from 
               accusative case to nominative occurred) as metropolis and probably benefactor of 
               the Greeks (which recalls the city's donations of corn to Greek cities in the fourth century BCE, SEG ix. 2).
               All this must be intended to explain why Hadrian has written to persons whose name is lost, 
               pointing out what is honourable and fitting for them (l. 20), in fact probably urging on them 
               the justice of behaving well to their metropolis (? œÑ·Ω∏ œÄœÅ·Ω∏œÇ œÑ·Ω¥ŒΩ ŒºŒ∑œÑœÅŒøœÄœåŒªŒπŒΩ Œµ·Ωñ œÄŒøŒπŒµ·øñŒΩ may 
               give the kind of sense in line  21). If that view is on the right lines, this document, 
               like the earlier ones, may arise from a challenge, presumably from one of her daughter 
               cities, to Cyrene's status.  But it is not clear why Hadrian should then refer to help 
               from the Greeks (1. 22).  Fraser's               
                  EŒõŒõA<gap reason="lost" extent="unknown" unit="character"/>, read from his squeeze, would solve this difficulty, giving, presumably, 
               ·ºôŒªŒª<unclear>Œ±</unclear><supplied reason="lost">Œ¥Œ¨œÅœáœâŒΩ</supplied>, but I still feel that <orig><unclear>Œ∑</unclear></orig><gap reason="lost" extent="unknown" unit="character"/>
               is more like what I saw on the stone. If I am right, the occasion could perhaps be connected with 
               a fragment of an approximately contemporary inscription in which Greeks (? other Cyrenaican Greeks 
               rather than Greeks in general) are begged to save their ' mother Cyrene ', and there is a reference 
               to gifts and to corn, followed by a list, which I take to be a list of subscribers, in which the 
               first name is Œ∏Œµ·Ω∏œÇ ·ºàŒ¥œÅŒπŒ±ŒΩœåœÇ (G. Oliverio, ASAA xxxix-xl (1961-2), 257, no. 68). 
               Alternatively, coming after one reference to population (1. 18) and before another 
               (l. 23), it may be that what was proposed was a voluntary ' colonization ' of Cyrene 
               by her daughter cities. Colonists were sent to Cyrenaica from elsewhere immediately 
               after the Jewish Revolt (Orosius VII. 12b and the inscription from Attaleia, Turk 
               Tarih Belleten xi (1947), 101 f. quoted by Fraser, p. 84, n. 37). We do not know whether any 
               of these went to Cyrene (but for a few possible traces of them see J. M. Reynolds, PCPS clxxxv 
               (1959), 27). A second despatch of colonists in or after 134/5 is a possibility. line  23, being outspaced, 
               may mark the start of a new paragraph (but see below under line  40); it seems to introduce 
               the emperor's wishes in relation to size of population. It may be that he wished increase 
               of population for every race and especially for Cyrene-‚Äîbut there is very little space for any 
               practical proposal (see above on line  20 f. for what he is known to have done).
            </p><p> line  25 carries a new heading, indicating again an excerpt from a document which, like Fraser, 
               I suppose to be described as an imperial edict, although its language is that of a letter. It appears 
               to have continued to line  63, unless another heading stood in the lost area after line  56.
            </p><p> lines 26 f., the emperor addresses a group who can, I believe, now be seen to be the 
               Cyrenaeans themselves (cf. Œø·º∞Œ∫ŒÆœÑŒøœÅŒ±œÇ in line  29) rather than Greeks from elsewhere, 
               whether the mainland or other parts of Cyrenaica, as originally suggested by Fraser. 
               He apparently urges them to take initiatives themselves. The general line of his argument 
               seems clear enough, despite the gaps in lines 26-8 : they should not yield to fear, but, remembering 
               that it is disgraceful to allow a city founded in accordance with Apolline oracles to lie in ruins in 
               a manner unworthy of its ancient fame, should become not simply residents but also founders of 
               what is their own country. In line  26 the sense that I suppose in the  gap would be provided by 
               something on the lines of œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ ·ºê<supplied reason="lost">œÄŒπœÑœÖœáŒøœÖœÉ·ø∂ŒΩ ·ΩëŒº·øñŒΩ Œ∫Œ±Œ∫ŒøœÄŒ±Œ∏ŒµŒπ·ø∂ŒΩ</supplied> ,
               followed by one or more adverbs, 
               such as <supplied reason="lost">·ºÄœÉŒ∏ŒµŒΩ</supplied><unclear>·ø∂</unclear>œÇ;

               while in 1. 29 the formulae printed seem reasonably probable.
            </p><p>What the new fragment has added here, besides the identity of those addressed, 
               is, I suggest, a strong likelihood that the point is not now population, but public buildings, 
               so that the difficulties over the gymnasium introduced in line  30 have a very straightforward 
               context. Not all the restorations of buildings at Cyrene in this,period are dated, but there is 
               a series from 118 and 119, when Hadrian himself was active and seems to show 
               a preoccupation with official works (a road, the Caesareum and Basilica, the Baths which had 
               been given to the city by Trajan); and then in 138 the city honours him in the dedication of 
               a base in the temple commonly called the Capitolium where it describes itself as 
               Œ∫ŒøœÉŒºŒ∑Œ∏Œµ·øñœÉŒ± ·ΩëœÄ‚ÄôŒ±·ΩêœÑŒø·ø¶ (<ref type="inscription" n="C70800">C.91</ref>). That may indicate that towards the end of his reign 
               Hadrian undertook a second programme to provide less essential but desirable Œ∫œåœÉŒºŒøœÇ 
               (see also Reynolds, op. cit. above under line  17). In the present document in fact Hadrian proceeds 
               from urging activity on the Cyrenaeans to a promise of specific help from himself; typically he 
               gives something connected with education. In line  31 he probably said that he hears that the gymnasium 
               is lying in ruins (perhaps something like Œ∫Œ±<supplied reason="lost">œÑŒ±Œ≤ŒªŒ∑Œ∏·øÜŒΩŒ±Œπ ·ºêŒΩ œÑ·ø∑

               is not, as Fraser guessed, a training ground in which old and new citizens could mingle together, 
               but one specifically for the young. Something was clearly in operation (œÑ·Ω∏ Œ∫ŒøŒπŒΩ·Ω∏ŒΩ Œ≥œÖŒºŒΩŒ¨œÉŒπŒøŒΩ in lines 32/3) 
               and the emperor undertook to provide a new gymnasium for ephebes in which they would not have to rub 
               shoulders with older men; frequenting this, so he argues, they would really appreciate the 
               imperial generosity. The sense might be given by something like Œ±·ΩêŒæ<supplied reason="lost">Œ±ŒΩŒøŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒøœÖœÇ

            </p><p>The gift was presumably the Hadrianic Gymnasium (Xystos) of Hermes and Herakles, 
               whose outer wall, fronting the street which ran from the Caesareum to the Agora, has recently 
               been re-erected by Professor Sandro Stucchi (S. Stucchi, Architettura Cirenaica (1975), 127 f. and fig. 109). 
               lines 36 f. contain a new section, as the vacat at the end of 1. 35 followed by the outspacing of 1. 36 
               shows, but it is very fragmentary despite the new additions. Hadrian seems to be referring to a 
               benefit conferred earlier, at urgent Cyrenaean request, which may be the ŒΩŒøŒºŒøŒ∏ŒµœÉŒØŒ± that I have 
               tentatively restored in 1. 36 (on the basis of SEGxvii. 80, dated to 128/9, in which Hadrian 
               is honoured as ŒΩŒøŒºŒøŒ∏Œ≠œÑŒ∑œÇ). If that is right, the following lines appear to be indicating that he 
               took the Spartan code for a model, as being particularly appropriate in view of the Spartan connections 
               of Cyrene's founders (for these see e.g. F. Kiechle, op. cit. (p. 116 above) on 1. 10, Josephus, BJ 11. 381 and 
               Synesius, Epp. 57). An inscription discovered in 1977 by the expedition from the Museum of the 
               University of Pennsylvania, working in the extra-mural temple of Demeter at Cyrene, also has a 
               bearing on this, and I am able to mention it by the generosity of Professor Donald White, the Director 
               of excavations:   its fragmentary lines contain the words ·ºÄŒ≥œâŒ≥·Ω∞ŒΩ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ œÉŒøœÜŒØŒ±ŒΩ and œÄŒ±ŒπŒ¥Œ≠Œ±œÇ, followed,
                     after a gap, by œÄŒ±œÅ·Ω∞ ŒõŒ±Œ∫ŒµŒ¥Œ±ŒπŒºŒø<supplied reason="lost">ŒΩŒØœâŒΩ</supplied>; 
               the stone carries no date and its worn letters seem at first sight to be a good deal earlier 
               than Hadrian; they perhaps indicate an earlier action of the same character as Hadrian's, 
               but I may have misdated them. In 1. 38 there seems to be a rhetorical question which perhaps
               made the same point.
            </p><p>l. 40, the vacat at the end is odd unless the line contained the end of the paragraph; 
               and it must be observed that line  41 is so badly damaged that it is impossible to be sure 
               that it was not outspaced; in fact I think that it must have been. On the other hand there 
               is a vacat, though a much smaller one, at the end of line  41 itself and line  42 is again outspaced. 
               line  42, however, and each of the next two outspaced lines, 44 and 47, open with a phrase 
               which is linked to the preceding lines by a particle or conjunction (yap in 11. 42, 44 and Kal in 1. 47), 
               so that they are unlikely to start new sections. It seems possible that in this area of the stone 
               outspacing was sometimes used for emphasis.
            </p><p>The reading at the beginning of line  41 seems to me too uncertain for conjecture. 
               The figure at the end may perhaps refer to four characteristic Spartan virtues which 
               Hadrian hoped to inculcate by his code: the œÉœâœÜœÅŒøœÉœçŒΩŒ∑ and ·ºÑœÉŒ∫Œ∑œÉŒπœÇ of line  43 and 
               two more. In 1. 44 the first word before the break seems likely to have been Œ≥Œ≠ŒΩŒøœÇ or Œ≥ŒµŒΩŒ≠œÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ;
               but by this point the text has become too defective for serious discussion. 
               In line  50 the god is presumably Apollo and perhaps Hadrian spoke of his Œ¥ŒπŒ∫Œ±ŒπŒøœÉœçŒΩŒ∑‚Äîor could
               there have been a reference (if so rather poetic in formulation) to the œÑœÅŒØœÄŒøœÖœÇ ŒºŒ±ŒΩœÑŒøœÉœçŒΩŒ∑?
                In line  54 there may perhaps have been mention of the elder of the two Cyrenaeans 
                named Ti. Claudius Jason Magnus whose family was prominent in the middle and 
                later second century, the son becoming president of the Panhellenion in 157 
                (see J. H. Oliver, Hesperia Supplement xiii, 115 f., and earlier discussion by 
                line  Moretti, Epigraphica xxxi (1969), 139 f., line  Robert, ·ºàœÅœá.-·ºòœÜ. 1969 (1970), 1 f.).
            </p><p>l. 55 may have contained some part of the verb ·ΩÄŒπŒ∫ŒØŒ∂œâ.
            </p><p>l. 63, the range of meanings of ·ºÄŒΩŒ±œÑŒØŒ∏ŒµŒºŒ±Œπ seems too wide to allow any certainty 
               about what the emperor gladly did.
            </p><p>l. 65, being unlinked to line  64, perhaps starts a new section in which two groups 
               are described, both introduced by ·ΩÖœÉŒøŒπ ·ºÑŒΩ. The first, stated to be from Cyrene (l. 65) and
               apparently going to be active there (l. 66), is in some way related to the proconsul (l. 67); 
               of the second, which may be from elsewhere but may also be from Cyrene, 
               nothing can be said with any certainty; in line  68 I am not clear how to break up the letter 
               groups (?œÑŒµŒ∏ŒΩŒ¨ŒΩŒ±Œπ Œ¥·Ω≤ ·ºêŒºŒø·ø¶, œÑŒµŒ∏ŒΩŒ¨ŒΩŒ±Œπ Œ¥ŒµœÉŒºŒø·ø¶).
            </p><p>Of the completely new documents the first is headed Chief points from 
               correspondence of the lord Antoninus (1. 69). The emperor must be Pius 
               (as also below in 11. 78 f., where his name and title are set out in full); he was presumably 
               alive when this line was inscribed. The general sense is clear: the Bereniceans had asked 
               that an assize court should be held in their city and when Pius refused to add to the burdens 
               of the governor proposed that, in future, assizes should be held at each city in turn; but Pius 
               was not prepared to accept the principle of rotation without the agreement of the cities whose 
               privileges would be curtailed thereby.
            </p><p> The summary falls into two clearly marked sections, in each of which a brief account 
               of the request made by the Bereniceans (ŒíŒµœÅŒΩŒµŒπŒ∫Œµ·øñœÇ ·º†ŒæŒØŒøœÖŒΩ..., line  70, ·ºÄŒæŒπŒøœçŒΩœÑœâŒΩ Œø·ΩñŒΩ œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ ŒíŒµœÅŒΩŒµŒπŒ∫Œ≠œâŒΩ..., line  73) 
               is followed by the essentials of the emperor's reply, given in his own words. lines 70-3 are surely taken 
               from a letter to the Bereniceans to whom the words ·Ω•œÉœÄŒµœÅ ·º¥œÉœÑŒµ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ·ΩëŒºŒµ·øñœÇ are most naturally addressed. 
               Obviously the emperor also wrote to the Bereniceans in reply to their second request (ll. 73 f.) 
               but the ·ΩëŒºŒµ·øñŒΩ of line  76 must be the cities which would lose their annual enjoyment of the court 
               if the request were granted. The excerptor used two documents, therefore, one addressed to the 
               Bereniceans and one to others, and it is necessary to 
               restore <supplied reason="lost">·ºêœÄŒπœÉœÑŒøŒª·ø∂ŒΩ</supplied> 
               not ·ºêœÄŒπœÉ<supplied reason="lost">œÑŒøŒª·øÜœÇ</supplied> in  line  69.
            </p><p>The length of the supplements in the centre and at the right-hand ends of the lines is 
               variable mainly because the surviving left-hand side of the stele is broken at the right on an 
               oblique line and so preserves less of the text the lower it descends, while the central and right 
               hand part has been recut to form a column base and so presents a circular edge; moreover in 
               some lines there has been more extensive damage in the area of the break. For the central gap 
               the supplements are certain (or virtually so) in lines 69 and 72, and for the right hand end 
               in lines 71, 72, 75 and 76; it is possible from this evidence to calculate an average line length of 66 letters.
            </p><p>l. 70, it is clear from lines 73, 74 that the object of the Berenicean request was that an 
               assize court should be held in their city. On assize courts see the material collected by Mommsen 
               (Ges. Schr. viii. 1. 534) and line  Robert, Rev. Phil, vn (1934), 277/8, Hellenica VII, 223 f., 
               Bull. Ep. 1968, 462 together with the more recent discussions of the conventus/ assize system 
               by Chr. Habicht, JRS lxv (1975), 64 f. and G. P. Burton, ibid., 92 f. (the latter drawing on the 
               inscription published here); the advantages to the cities in which they were held were 
               considerable, not only in the easy availability of justice but also, as indicated by Dio Chrysostom, 
               Or. xxxv. 15, in the trade brought by visitors. For local jealousy of assize towns see Dio Chrysostom, 
               XL. 35 and the discussion by Burton, op. cit., 100.   The standard description is ·ºÄŒ≥ŒøœÅ·Ω∞ Œ¥ŒπŒ∫·ø∂ŒΩ 
               or ·º° ·ºÄŒ≥ŒøœÅŒ±ŒØŒøœÇ (·ºÄŒ≥ŒøœÅŒ±ŒØŒ±); cf. the instances in

               is perhaps not impossible. At the end of the line a conjunction meaning how is wanted; 
               there seems no room for more than ·Ω°œÇ.
            </p><p>l. 75 makes it perfectly clear that in the assize towns of Crete and Cyrene at this 
               time an annual session was the rule, as it is likely to have been in other provinces too, see
               Burton, op. cit. under line  70, p. 97-9.
            </p><p>The identification of the cities at which assizes were already held is uncertain. 
               Since Pius stresses the pressures on the time that the proconsul could spend in Cyrenaica, 
               the Cretan cities can presumably be excluded. Cyrene was certainly an assize town, being 
               in any case the metropolis; it is also pertinent to remember Hadrian's swift reconstruction 
               of its civil basilica after the Jewish Revolt, cf. E. M. Smallwood, JRS xlii (1952), 37 f.; but 
               Apollonia, in view of its proximity to Cyrene, was surely not. On geographical grounds 
               one might expect a second assize town west of the Wadi Cuf which cuts the territory in 
               two, and since Berenice was clearly not one it should be either Teucheira or Ptolemais. Hadrian 
               is known to have restored a basilica suitable for the purpose at Teucheira after the Jewish Revolt 
               (unpublished inscription excavated by Goodchild), but there is nothing else there at present to 
               indicate regular visits from the governor. At Ptolemais there are several inscriptions which are 
               suggestive, although not conclusive, evidence that this was an assize town (note especially 
               C. H. Kraeling, Ptolemais, 210, no. 11, a proconsul acting with assessors, as the word adhibitis 
               implies, and J. M. Reynolds PBSR xxx (1962), 34 f., no. 2; xxxm (1965), 52 f. nos. a and b, vota 
               pro salute principis recorded there); it may also be relevant that in Diocletian's reorganization it 
               was Ptolemais which became the new provincial capital. Ptolemais and Teucheira are so close 
               together that one would hardly expect an assize in both.
            </p><p>The suggestion that the governor of Crete and Cyrene was worked to the reasonable limit 
               is interesting and perhaps relevant to the possibility that in the early third century the two areas 
               were, for a time, separated; see H. G. Pflaum, Annuaire de VF.cole Pratique des Hautes Etudes 
               1974, 271 f., by whom, however, I am not quite convinced.
            </p><p>ll. 75-7, the supplements seem reasonably clear; and if ·ºÄŒ¥ŒπŒ∫·øÜœÉŒ±Œπ is not the right 
               word it must surely‚Ä®give the right sense.
            </p><p>The second document is a copy of a letter from Antoninus Pius to 
               Ptolemais dated by his titles to 153/4 (1. 80). Again the general lines are absolutely clear. 
               The Ptolemaeans, through their ambassador Valerius Pausanias, had asked for permission 
               to hold an ·ºÄŒ≥œéŒΩ in their city; Pius replied, apparently sarcastically, that they had hitherto 
               been wisely satisfied to participate in the common sacrifice and ·ºÄŒ≥œéŒΩ held at Cyrene, 
               and were well aware that innovations of this sort carried the stigma of inter-city rivalry.   
               The common sacrifice had been established for the whole province.
            </p><p>l. 80, for the address of the letter to the citizens in this way, see on line  5 above; 
               it was presumably ‚Ä®how the ambassador had described his city. It is also of interest that 
               the citizens are described as Œ†œÑŒøŒªŒµŒºŒ±ŒπŒµ·øñœÇ ŒíŒ±œÅŒ∫Œ±·øñŒøŒπ. 
               In the Greek period the city centre was at Barka and the site of Ptolemais was ‚Ä®simply its 
               subordinate port; it was probably Ptolemy III who developed the port and named it for‚Ä®himself, 
               reducing Barka to the position of subordinate (see Kraeling, op. cit. under 1. 74, 5 f. and 
               line ‚Ä®Moretti, Riv. Fil. civ (1976), 186 f.). There are, however, several inscriptions of the Roman 
               period‚Ä® in which the name of Barka is linked with that of Ptolemais, none likely to be earlier 
               than the second‚Ä®century CE but none precisely dated except this one (see J. M. Reynolds, Riv. 
               Fil. forthcoming).
            </p><p>ll. 81-2, the supplements seem obvious. For the sarcastic tone of the emperor cf. 
               W. Williams,‚Ä® JRS lxvi (1976), 74 f., arguing that this is a characteristic of Pius' epistolary style 
               (see also V.‚Ä®Nutton, JRS lxi (1971), 56 for a good example). The common sacrifice and contest 
               at Cyrene are‚Ä®presumably to be associated with the provincial cult conducted by the provincial 
               koinon (cf. 1. 84‚Ä®below); I have not found another example of the formula œÉœÖŒΩŒ∏œçŒµŒπŒΩ Œµ·º∞œÇ œÑ·Ω∏ŒΩ ·ºÄŒ≥·ø∂ŒΩŒ±,
               but the sense does‚Ä®not seem difficult to follow.
            </p><p>l. 83, Œ∫Œ±ŒπŒΩŒøœÑŒøŒºŒµ·øñŒΩ with the implication of undesirable innovation is well attested. 
               In the central gap Œ±·º∞œÑŒØŒ±ŒΩ seems to give the sense needed in about the right number of letters. 
               For œÜŒπŒªŒøŒΩŒµŒπŒ∫ŒØŒ± between cities at this period cf. Syll.3 849 (Ephesus and Smyrna),
               with Dittenberger's references to Dio
                     Chrysostom xxxiv. 48, Aelius Aristides xxm, and Cassius Dio lh. 37. 10; the issue in 
                     these passages is often essentially one of titles, whereas here there is certainly some point 
                     of substance involving celebration of a festival which, like the assize court, would bring 
                     visitors and opportunities for profit. It will, no doubt, also have involved payment 
                     of contributions by participating cities, as in the mid-third-century case of the Philadelphians 
                     in relation to the organization of the koinon of Asia (SEG xvii. 528).
            </p><p>ll. 83/4, it would seem natural to restore <supplied reason="lost">·º° œÉœÖŒΩ</supplied>Œ∏œÖœÉŒØŒ± , 
               recalling the œÉœÖŒΩŒ∏œÖœÉŒØŒ± of Syll.3 849,line 11 which Dittenberger connected with the cult activities of the koinon 
               of Asia; but if that is right I find it hard to envisage a restoration for the lost area at the centre of 
               line  84. What survives there suggests a passive participle such as Œ∫Œ±Œ∏ŒµœÉœÑŒ±ŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒ±
               which requires a neuter plural instead of a feminine singular subject; 
               but LSJ offers no authority for <supplied reason="lost">œÑ·Ω∞</supplied> Œ∏œçœÉŒπŒ±.
            </p><p>l. 84. For ·ºîŒ∏ŒΩŒøœÇ = province see the passage of Modestinus quoted 
               under 1. 70 and Mason, op. cit. under 1. 6 f., s.v.
            </p><p>ll. 84/5, on the final formula see W. Williams, Historia xvi (1967), 470 f., 
               arguing that under Hadrian and in the early years of Pius' reign the rider authorizing 
               payment to ambassadors occurs only when the matter raised is substantial and that from 
               c. 145 Pius insisted that superficial points should be forwarded via governors. The Ptolemaean 
               case clearly rated as important. It is a little earlier than Williams' earliest case of authorization 
               of payment by Pius after the change of procedure that he posits (SEG xiv. 479 of 155).
            </p><p>The incident fits very well into our general picture of escalating civic rivalry, opposed by 
                     the emperors, at this period. </p>-->
